        <div class="question">1. What are the most popular menu items?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            The most popular menu items at Roni's Mac Bar Sales is "Mac and Cheese" and the "Aggie Bowl". These items have consistently had high sales, especially during lunch and dinner hours. 
            The "Aggie Bowl" is particularly popular with customers who decide to supplement it with customization/add-ons like cheddar, brisket, and garlic parmesan.
        </div>

        <div class="question">2. Are there any seasonal (days of week, month) trends or peaks in demand?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Yes, there are clear some clear patterns. Fridays and Saturdays show a 20% increase in sales compared to other weekdays, indicating higher customer volume during the weekends at Roni's.
            Additionally, there is a prominent increase in orders during lunchtime, around 12-2 PM, and dinner time from 5-8 PM. Monthly data shows a spike in sales during the festive season in December.
        </div>

        <div class="question">3. How can Roni's optimize meal preparation based on efficiency logs?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            To optimize meal preparation, Roniâ€™s should consider preparing popular ingredients like cheddar, brisket, and breadcrumbs, which are often added to the "Aggie Bowl" and "Mac and Cheese", in advance. 
            Ensuring enough inventory and preparing these ingredients ahead of time, especially before lunch and dinner peaks, can help reduce meal-prep time and ensure efficiency. 
        </div>

        <div class="question">4. Are there any bottlenecks or delays in the meal preparation process?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Looking at the preparation process reveals that bottlenecks often occur during the peak hours, primarily due to the high demand for popular items with added modifiers.
            By allocating additional staff during these peak periods, Roni's can minimize delays. Creating a priority hierarchy for ingredients could also help, giving more importance to items that are ordered more.
